# General API Information

The Rackspace Cloud Service Registry API provides a RESTful web service
interface. All requests to authenticate and operate against the Rackspace
Cloud Service Registry API are performed using SSL over HTTPS on TCP port 443.

## Endpoint Access

Rackspace Cloud Service Registry runs as a separate instance in multiple
regions. You are advised to pick the region which is closest to your
servers.

During preview, only a single instance in DFW is active. You can reach it at the
address bellow:

https://dfw.registry.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/1234

Replace the sample account ID number, 1234, with your actual account number.
Your account number is returned as part of the authentication service
response, after the final '/' in the X-Server-Management-Url header. See
[Authentication](TODO) for more information.

## Request / Response Types

The Rackspace Cloud Service Registry API supports JSON data serialization
format. The request format is specified using the Content-Type header and is
required for operations that have a request body.

### Supported response types

Format | Accept
------ | ------
JSON | application/json

## Versions

The Rackspace Cloud Service Registry API uses a URI versioning scheme. In the
URI scheme, the first element of the path contains the target version
identifier (e.g. https://dfw.registry.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/â€¦).

```shell
GET /sessions HTTP/1.1
Host: dfw.registry.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/1234
Accept: application/json
X-Auth-Token: eaaafd18-0fed-4b3a-81b4-663c99ec1cbb
```

New features and functionality that do not break API-compatibility will be
introduced in the current version of the API and the URI will remain
unchanged. Features or functionality changes that would necessitate a break
in API-compatibility will require a new version, which will result in the
URI version being updated accordingly. When new API versions are released,
older versions will be marked as DEPRECATED.

## Paginated Collections

To reduce load on the service, list operations will return a maximum number
of items at a time. To navigate the collection, the parameters "limit" and
"marker" can be set in the URI (e.g. `?limit=200&marker=enCCCCCC`). The
marker parameter is the ID of the first item in the next page. This item
can be found in the metadata object under the `next_key` tag. Items are
sorted by the ID name in lexicographic order. The limit parameter sets the
page size. It defaults to `100` items per page and the maximum value is
`1000`. Both parameters are optional. If the client requests a limit beyond
that which is supported, an invalidLimit (400) fault may be thrown.

For convenience, collections contain a link to the next page (the
`next_href` attribute in the metadata object). If there are no more
objects, the `next_key` and next_href attributes will be empty. The
following examples illustrate two pages in a collection of services. The
first page was retrieved via a GET to https://todo.api.rackspacecloud.com
v1.0/services?limit=1. In these examples, the limit parameter sets the page
size to a single item. The subsequent next_href link will honor the initial
page size. Thus, a client may follow this link to traverse a paginated
collection without having to input the limit parameter.

### List Services, First Page (?limit=1)

```javascript
{
    "values": [
        {
            "id": "dfw1-api",
            "session_id": "seOne",
            "tags": [],
            "metadata": {}
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "count": 1,
        "limit": 1,
        "marker": null,
        "next_marker": "dfw1-messenger",
        "next_href": "https://todo.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/7777/services?limit=1&marker=dfw1-messenger"
    }
}
```

### List Services, Second Page (?marker=dfw1-messenger)

```javascript
{
    "values": [
        {
            "id": "dfw1-messenger",
            "session_id": "seOne",
            "tags": [
                "tag1",
                "tag2",
                "tag3"
            ],
            "metadata": {
                "region": "dfw",
                "port": "5757",
                "ip": "127.0.0.1"
            }
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "count": 1,
        "limit": 100,
        "marker": "dfw1-messenger",
        "next_href": null
    }
}
```

In the JSON representation, paginated collections contain a `values`
property that contains the items in the collection. The link to the next
page is located in the metadata object (`metadata.next_href` attribute).
Clients must follow the next_href link to continue to retrieve additional
entities belonging to an account.

## Rate Limits

## Faults

When an error occurs the system returns an HTTP error response code denoting
the type of error and additional information in the fault response body.

The following examples show a response body for a 404 notFoundError.

### Not Found Error Response

```javascript
{
    "type": "notFoundError",
    "code": 404,
    "message": "object does not exist",
    "details": "Object \"Session\" with key \"seNotFound\" does not exist",
    "txnId": ".rh-qyek.h-farscape.r-q3i5psGp.c-3.ts-1347320188220.v-0.1"
}
```
