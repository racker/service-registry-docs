# Overview

## What is Rackspace Service Registry

Rackspace Service Registry allows developers to build highly
available and responsive applications using a simple but powerful REST API.
Currently it exposes three groups of functionalities:

### Service Discovery

Find which services are currently online/active and find services based on
different criteria.

### Platform for Automation

Service Registry exposes an events feed which includes all of the events
that happened during the life-cycle of your account (e.g. service comes
online, configuration value gets updated, etc.).

Events feed is a great information source about your infrastucture and can
be used to kick off a lot of different automation processes. Examples
include, but are not limited to:

- Add a web service to a load-balancer when it comes online
- Open a ticket in the internal ticketing system when a service goes offline
- Re-initialize the connection pool inside your application when a
configuration value changes
- Boot a new Cloud Server with the service when a service times out

### Configuration Storage

Configuration storage allows users to store arbitrary configuration values
in our system and get notified via the events feed when a value gets
updated or deleted.

For more information about the basic foundations of this API, refer to
[Chapter 2, Concepts](Concepts).
